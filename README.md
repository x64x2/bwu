Compiling
---------
You will need a compiler supporting C++11.
So far, only gcc on trisquel has been used, although the code is very portable.

Resources
---------
These are needed to run the game in it's current form.
I've shared them publicly in my Dropbox: http://bit.ly/1myJJk0
Copy everything from there to the /resources directory.
